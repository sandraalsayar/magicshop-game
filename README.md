Magic Shop is a GBA game I created using the GBA emulator and C language.
All of the artwork and code is mine. Music is by Smyang Piano

This game was a month-long project for a game class at Georgia Tech.
I presented this game in class & received a score of 105/100.
I implemented techniques not taught in class (such as alpha blending) and had an extensive storyline.

Here's the intro I gave:
Magic Shop is a psychodramatic technique that exchanges fear for a positive attitude. 
In simple words, the Magic Shop is a place where protagonists, the main characters in a psychodramatic scene,
will either try to acquire or to give up something.
The therapist, who is the shopkeeper, sets the stage, without drawing the line between fantasy and reality.
I heard about this technique last year through a BTS song called "Magic Shop", and it inspired me so I decided to make it my game’s theme.
I want my game to take the player on a journey.
Pretend that you are the character and your are seeking something you can’t find anywhere else in the world, except at the magic shop.
Everything comes with a price of course, but thankfully, this is the kind of a shop where the shopkeeper has the buyer’s best intentions
in mind, not profit. So by paying him, you are benefiting yourself.
Now just a quick note, my game remains just a game and only the storyline relates to the psychdramatic technique.

I will upload my recorded presentation on YouTube, so look forward to it!
